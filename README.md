### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is the github profile of Quesnok  - Fullstack Developer and Streamer.
All the projects, scripts and examples I build on stream will be uploaded here.
I might also collect some sheets, scripts or repos I consider helpfull.

[Projects](https://github.com/CCiwy/CCiwy/blob/main/README.md#projects-overview) - [Twitch](https://github.com/CCiwy/CCiwy/blob/main/README.md#about-my-twitch-channel) - [Contact](https://github.com/CCiwy/CCiwy/blob/main/README.md#-reach-out-to-me-)

Python for backend, TypeScript/JavaScript/HTML/CSS for frontend. Python and Bash for scripts (mostly around setting up projects, managing projects and deployment).
SQL (mostly Postgres or mariaDB) for Databases. Some experience with mongoDB.
Played around with Rust and Zig, but i'm at a beginner level.
I have used PHP and JAVA in the past, but not in the recent years. I also did some
C, C# and C++ but I'm completly out of practice.

# Projects Overview
This is a short summary of my repositories, a brief introduction into my projects.
If you want to read more about the projects checkout their respective README or ROADMAP files.


## Full projects
Full projects I build on stream. They have a specific reason why I started to build them and, at some point in time, should be considered "complete".


### [py-starlette-base](https://github.com/CCiwy/py-starlette-base)
a boilerplate project for webapplications build in python with [starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette). It aims at minimizing the work that needs to be done to create new webapplications (CRUD/REST).
It includes a basic controller for routes, an async database connection module (build with [sqlalchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy)), logging (stdout, files, mail), error-handling and a configparser.

On the "usercontroller" branch is a basic implementation of a controller (for a '/user' endpoint) including account creation and authentication.

This project could already be reused, but is still work in progress.

### [py-twitch-bot](https://github.com/CCiwy/py-twitch-bot)
This is the actual Bot that runs in my Twitch-Chat. I wanted to create a Bot for Twitch that could be highly customized via web-interface and codebase. The Idea ist to build a strong foundation that handles all the background work by also allowing to change every little detail. 

This project is still under construction.

### [py-config](https://github.com/CCiwy/py-config)
Configparser for python applications. Allows reading of .json and .py-files.
Easy extends applications and load configuration files, easy access vars stored.


This project can already be used but will receive some updates in the future.

## Learning or Teaching something new
This are projects build without any special purpose other than undertanding/teaching a particular technology.
These projects will be like a playground to get familiar with the specifics of a framework/language/dbrm etc.


### [py-bottle-learning](https://github.com/CCiwy/py-bottle-learning)
Playground for [bottlepy](https://github.com/bottlepy).


### [py-docker-postgres](https://github.com/CCiwy/py-docker-postgres)
Showcase how to setup a local postgres-docker container and connect to it with python.


### [example-repo](https://github.com/CCiwy/example-repo)
A project merely created in order to explain the usage of git and github to viewers on my stream. This project will be updated from time to time, but without any real code, since its all about git commits and branches.



### [py-array-playground](https://github.com/CCiwy/py-array-playground)
A pyton file I created for one of my viewers to explain how he could handle "arrays of arrays". As i understood he needed something for his scientific research and didnt know if python could be helpfull for his usecase.

## About my Twitch channel
On my twitch channel [twitch.tv/quesnok](https://www.twitch.tv/quesnok) I stream pretty regularly, depending on how much free time I have.
My goals are to teach and learn by building usefull stuff that others can use and establish a nice community along the way.


#### Stream Language
I stream in english, but since i'm a native german speaker i will respond to german in chat, too. Sometimes i will also just speak german for a short period - dont get confused if you join the stream and I am not speaking english, just let me know that you need me to switch language in order for you to understand.

#### Community
Community-Discord is linked in the channels description.

## ************** reach out to me **************
I build web-based applications, mostly around processing documents and user-input into documents or statistics. Furthermore, I provide the servers and maintain the applications, if desired.
If you want to contract/hire me write a mail to info[at]afk-dev.de

If you want to  contribute to my projects, I think it would make sense if you contact me on discord first. The discord server is linked on my twitch profile.
